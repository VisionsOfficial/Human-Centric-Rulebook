Description for the endpoints of the various APIs are described below.

## API

The server speaks [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). It's recommended that every call to the server includes a `Content-Type` header set to `application/json; charset=utf-8;`.

Requests with `POST` or `PUT` method must send data as `application/json`.

```bash
$ curl -X 'POST' '{url}' \
       -H 'Authorization: Bearer {jwt}' \
       -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8' \
       -d $'{...}'
```

## Authentication

Most of the API routes restrict public access and require authentication. Authenticated requests read follow a Bearer Authentication method and must include a HTTP header `Authorization` holding `Bearer ` followed by the JWT token.

To retrieve a JWT token for your Service, a post request must be made to the following endpoint.

#### [public] POST /api/authenticate/token
